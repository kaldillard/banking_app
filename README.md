A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Key Features:

Currency selector (USD) with notification badge
Quick "Add Money" functionality with a styled button

User Interaction:

Send money feature with user avatar selection
Quick access to frequently contacted users (Mary, Jake, Lucy, Steph)
Intuitive send button with arrow icon

Transaction History:

Daily transaction summary with total spending
Individual transaction listings showing:

Company/merchant icons (Amazon, Apple)

Clean list format for easy scanning

Navigation:

Bottom navigation bar with 4 main sections:

Investment/Growth (seedling icon)
Credit Card management
User profile



Design Highlights:

Modern card-based layout with rounded corners
Consistent color scheme using primary theme colors
FontAwesome icons throughout for visual consistency
Responsive design with proper spacing and typography

Note: This is currently a UI prototype only - all buttons, transactions, and user interactions are visual mockups without actual banking functionality or backend integration. The app demonstrates the user interface design and user experience flow for a full-featured banking application.
